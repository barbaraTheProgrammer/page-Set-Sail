# page-Set-Sail

I made this project to understand how to make pages in html. I was learning HTML, CSS and Js by myself, beacuse I wanted to get an internship for summer.
I'm satisfied with the reasult. I think the page is nice and it's really good as a first time! Of course there are things that I could better (mainly responsiveness),
but the page is okey anyway.

Page is about small company whitch organize crouises. Although this page is not available in the Internet, I'm glad I can show it here.
